# SatIPlayer
A Sat>IP Video Player for Windows that uses the VLC video rendering control but provides a custom-tailored GUI for satellite over IP use (SatIP).

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org) can be used to watch Sat>IP, but I found its GUI quite inconvenientfor this use-case, so I created SatIPlayer.
Another benefit of this repository is that you can use it as sample code how to use the [VLC .Net Control](https://github.com/ZeBobo5/Vlc.DotNet).

Some icons from taken from [Icons8](https://icons8.com).
GUI-Controls and other icons from [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com)
