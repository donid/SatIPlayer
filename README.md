# SatIPlayer
A Sat>IP Player that uses the VLC video rendering control but provides a custom-tailored GUI for Sat>IP use.

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org) can be used to watch Sat>IP, but I found its GUI quite inconvenientfor this use-case, so I created SatIPlayer.
Another benefit of this repository is that you can use it as sample code how to use the [VLC .Net Control](https://github.com/ZeBobo5/Vlc.DotNet).
